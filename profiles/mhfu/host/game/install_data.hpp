// The game's Data Install, served from DATA.BIN instead of stored.
//
// Data Install copies the raw (still obfuscated) bytes of most DATA.BIN
// entries into numbered files, ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10391DAT/00000000 and
// on. An entry is installed when the executable keeps a SHA-1 of it (a table
// of 20 bytes per entry at 0x08979924; all zero for the others). The entries
// go in order, each taking its whole blocks, and a new file starts where the
// next entry would take a file past 0x370000 bytes. At start the game lists
// the folder (save-data FILES) and checks every file's size against that
// packing; from then on it reads each installed entry from its file. Traced
// on USA Freedom Unite: the game's own install matches this packing file for
// file, with each entry's bytes as on the disc.
//
// Stored, the copy would also hide the mods from the game, which read the
// archive only. Served, each file is read from DATA.BIN as the mods leave it,
// laid out by the directory the game sees.
